# fbm-json-to-html
Create HTML file from Facebook takeout json message format.

This is a quick and easy way to convert your FB Messenger json file to an HTML document.
Usage: php fbm-json-to-html.php file=/tmp/message.json

Feel free to add to it. I haven't done any media features, no autolink or anything. Just timestamp, sender and text message.
